# Deploy Static Website to AWS
The cloud is perfect for hosting static websites that only include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that require no server-side processing. The whole project has two major intentions that were implemented:

Hosted a static website on S3 and
Accessed the cached website pages using CloudFront content delivery network (CDN) service.
Deployed a static website to AWS
Created a public S3 bucket and upload the website files to your bucket.
Configured the bucket for website hosting and secure it using IAM policies.
Sped up content delivery using AWSâ€™s content distribution network service, CloudFront.
Accessed the website in a browser using the unique CloudFront endpoint.
